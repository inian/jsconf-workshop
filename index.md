# Advanced Image Optimisation

## Workshop Overview

## Why images are important for performance

## Overview of different image formats
### GIF
- The oldest image format, created in 1987!
- Supports animation and transparency
- Data arranged in different types of blocks
- Each GIF frame has a colour palette of a maximum size of 256 entries. This is one of the biggest limitations of the GIF format is that each frame can have only at most 256 colours. 
- Uses LZW compression which was pretty patent encumbered
- Interlace option to allow a rough version of an image to be displayed before the full image has been transmitted
